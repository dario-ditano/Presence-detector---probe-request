# Presence-detector

This detection system uses probe request packets and ESP 32 cards. 
Once 3 or more cards have been arranged in a room, it is possible to triangulate the signals and thus estimate how many people are present in a room.
There is also an interface that allows you to view the devices on a map of the room, where there are numerous options.
